# emscripten-example

A simple example project for porting a command-line C program to a JavaScript
library using Emscripten.  Here, the program reads a file and writes its output
to another file.

There is a [similar example](https://github.com/kripken/xml.js/), but instead
of writing a *hacky wrapper* using `sed`, this one uses the `MODULARIZE` option
together with `--pre-js` and `--post-js` wrappers to write input file and read
output file.

## Dependencies

* gcc
* cmake
* emscripten

## Usage

Clone the repository and run `npm run build` to build the library.  You can
then run `npm run test` to test it (check `test.js`).  Also, `npm run
build:debug` builds the project without optimizations.
